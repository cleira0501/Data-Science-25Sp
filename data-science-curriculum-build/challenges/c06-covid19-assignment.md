*Purpose*: In this challenge, you’ll learn how to navigate the U.S.
Census Bureau website, programmatically download data from the internet,
and perform a county-level population-weighted analysis of current
COVID-19 trends. This will give you the base for a very deep
investigation of COVID-19, which we’ll build upon for Project 1.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and

*Background*:
[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) is
the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. In 2020 it became a global
pandemic, leading to huge loss of life and tremendous disruption to
society. The New York Times (as of writing) publishes up-to-date data on
the progression of the pandemic across the United States—we will study
these data in this challenge.

*Optional Readings*: I’ve found this [ProPublica
piece](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-understand-covid-19-numbers)
on “How to understand COVID-19 numbers” to be very informative!

# The Big Picture

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

We’re about to go through *a lot* of weird steps, so let’s first fix the
big picture firmly in mind:

We want to study COVID-19 in terms of data: both case counts (number of
infections) and deaths. We’re going to do a county-level analysis in
order to get a high-resolution view of the pandemic. Since US counties
can vary widely in terms of their population, we’ll need population
estimates in order to compute infection rates (think back to the
`Titanic` challenge).

That’s the high-level view; now let’s dig into the details.

# Get the Data

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

1.  County-level population estimates (Census Bureau)
2.  County-level COVID- 19 counts (New York Times)

## Navigating the Census Bureau

<!-- ------------------------- -->

**Steps**: Our objective is to find the 2018 American Community
Survey\[1\] (ACS) Total Population estimates, disaggregated by counties.
To check your results, this is Table `B01003`. 1. Go to
[data.census.gov](data.census.gov). 2. Scroll down and click
`View Tables`. 3. Apply filters to find the ACS **Total Population**
estimates, disaggregated by counties. I used the filters: -
`Topics > Populations and People > Counts, Estimates, and Projections > Population Total` -
`Geography > County > All counties in United States` 5. Select the
**Total Population** table and click the `Download` button to download
the data; make sure to select the 2018 5-year estimates. 6. Unzip and
move the data to your `challenges/data` folder. - Note that the data
will have a crazy-long filename like
`ACSDT5Y2018.B01003_data_with_overlays_2020-07-26T094857.csv`. That’s
because metadata is stored in the filename, such as the year of the
estimate (`Y2018`) and my access date (`2020-07-26`). **Your filename
will vary based on when you download the data**, so make sure to copy
the filename that corresponds to what you downloaded!

### **q1** Load Table `B01003` into the following tibble. Make sure the column names are `id, Geographic Area Name, Estimate!!Total, Margin of Error!!Total`.

*Hint*: You will need to use the `skip` keyword when loading these data!

``` r
## TASK: Load the census bureau data with the following tibble name.
df_pop <- read_csv("./data/2018_use/ACSDT5Y2018.B01003-Data.csv", 
                   skip = 1,
                   col_names = c("id", "Geographic Area Name", "Estimate!!Total", 
                                 "Margin of Error!!Total"))
```

    ## Rows: 3221 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (4): id, Geographic Area Name, Estimate!!Total, Margin of Error!!Total
    ## lgl (1): X5
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_pop
```

    ##    <chr>   <chr>                  <chr>             <chr>                  <lgl>

    ##  8 050000… Butler County, Alabama 20025             *****                  NA   
    ##  9 050000… Calhoun County, Alaba… 115098            *****                  NA   
    ## 10 050000… Chambers County, Alab… 33826             *****                  NA   
    ## # ℹ 3,211 more rows
    ## # ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Margin of Error!!Total`

*Note*: You can find information on 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates
[here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html).
The punchline is that 5-year estimates are more reliable but less
current.

## Automated Download of NYT Data

<!-- ------------------------- -->

ACS 5-year estimates don’t change all that often, but the COVID-19 data
are changing rapidly. To that end, it would be nice to be able to
*programmatically* download the most recent data for analysis; that way
we can update our analysis whenever we want simply by re-running our
notebook. This next problem will have you set up such a pipeline.

The New York Times is publishing up-to-date data on COVID-19 on
[GitHub](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

### **q2** Visit the NYT [GitHub](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) repo and find the URL for the **raw** US County-level data. Assign that URL as a string to the variable below.

``` r
## TASK: Find the URL for the NYT covid-19 county-level data
url_counties <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/refs/heads/master/us-counties.csv"
```

Once you have the url, the following code will download a local copy of
the data, then load the data into R.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this; just execute
## Set the filename of the data to download
filename_nyt <- "./data/nyt_counties.csv"

## Download the data locally
curl::curl_download(
        url_counties,
        destfile = filename_nyt
      )

## Loads the downloaded csv
df_covid <- read_csv(filename_nyt)
```

    ## Rows: 2502832 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr  (3): county, state, fips
    ## dbl  (2): cases, deaths
    ## date (1): date
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

You can now re-run the chunk above (or the entire notebook) to pull the
most recent version of the data. Thus you can periodically re-run this
notebook to check in on the pandemic as it evolves.

*Note*: You should feel free to copy-paste the code above for your own
future projects!

# Join the Data

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

To get a sense of our task, let’s take a glimpse at our two data
sources.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this; just execute
df_pop %>% glimpse
```

    ## Rows: 3,221
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ id                       <chr> "Geography", "0500000US01001", "0500000US0100…

    ## Rows: 2,502,832
    ## Columns: 6
    ## $ date   <date> 2020-01-21, 2020-01-22, 2020-01-23, 2020-01-24, 2020-01-24, 20…

    ## $ fips   <chr> "53061", "53061", "53061", "17031", "53061", "06059", "17031", …
    ## $ cases  <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …
    ## $ deaths <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …

To join these datasets, we’ll need to use [FIPS county
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code).\[2\] The last
`5` digits of the `id` column in `df_pop` is the FIPS county code, while
the NYT data `df_covid` already contains the `fips`.

### **q3** Process the `id` column of `df_pop` to create a `fips` column.

``` r
## TASK: Create a `fips` column by extracting the county code
#colnames(df_pop) <- make.names(colnames(df_pop), unique = TRUE)

df_q3 <- df_pop %>%
  mutate(
    fips = str_extract(string = id, pattern = "\\d{5}$")
    )
df_pop %>% glimpse
```

    ## Rows: 3,221
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ id                       <chr> "Geography", "0500000US01001", "0500000US0100…

Use the following test to check your answer.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
## Check known county
assertthat::assert_that(
              (df_q3 %>%
              filter(str_detect(`Geographic Area Name`, "Autauga County")) %>%
              pull(fips)) == "01001"
            )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Very good!")
```

    ## [1] "Very good!"

### **q4** Join `df_covid` with `df_q3` by the `fips` column. Use the proper type of join to preserve *only* the rows in `df_covid`.

``` r
## TASK: Join df_covid and df_q3 by fips.
df_q4 <- df_covid %>%
  left_join(df_q3, by = "fips")
```

Use the following test to check your answer.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
if (!any(df_q4 %>% pull(fips) %>% str_detect(., "02105"), na.rm = TRUE)) {
  assertthat::assert_that(TRUE)
} else {
  print(str_c(
    "Your df_q4 contains a row for the Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (AK),",
    "which is not in df_covid. You used the incorrect join type.",
    sep = " "
  ))
  assertthat::assert_that(FALSE)
}
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
if (any(df_q4 %>% pull(fips) %>% str_detect(., "78010"), na.rm = TRUE)) {
  assertthat::assert_that(TRUE)
} else {
  print(str_c(
    "Your df_q4 does not include St. Croix, US Virgin Islands,",
    "which is in df_covid. You used the incorrect join type.",
    sep = " "
  ))
  assertthat::assert_that(FALSE)
}
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Very good!")
```

    ## [1] "Very good!"

For convenience, I down-select some columns and produce more convenient
column names.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this to produce a more convenient tibble
df_data <-
  df_q4 %>%
  select(
    date,
    county,
    state,
    fips,

# Analyze

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now that we’ve done the hard work of loading and wrangling the data, we
can finally start our analysis. Our first step will be to produce county
population-normalized cases and death counts. Then we will explore the
data.

## Normalize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q5** Use the `population` estimates in `df_data` to normalize `cases` and `deaths` to produce per 100,000 counts \[3\]. Store these values in the columns `cases_per100k` and `deaths_per100k`.

``` r
## TASK: Normalize cases and deaths
df_normalized <-
  df_data %>% 
   mutate(
    cases = as.numeric(cases),
    deaths = as.numeric(deaths),
    population = as.numeric(population),
    cases_per100k = (cases / population) * 100000,
    deaths_per100k = (deaths / population) * 100000
  )
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `population = as.numeric(population)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion

You may use the following test to check your work.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
## Check known county data
if (any(df_normalized %>% pull(date) %>% str_detect(., "2020-01-21"))) {
  assertthat::assert_that(TRUE)
} else {
  print(str_c(
    "Date 2020-01-21 not found; did you download the historical data (correct),",
    "or just the most recent data (incorrect)?",
    sep = " "
  ))
  assertthat::assert_that(FALSE)
}
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r

    "Date 2022-05-13 not found; did you download the historical data (correct),",
    "or a single year's data (incorrect)?",
    sep = " "
  ))
  assertthat::assert_that(FALSE)
}
```

## Guided EDA

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Before turning you loose, let’s complete a couple guided EDA tasks.

### **q6** Compute some summaries

Compute the mean and standard deviation for `cases_per100k` and
`deaths_per100k`. *Make sure to carefully choose **which rows** to
include in your summaries,* and justify why!

``` r
## TASK: Compute mean and sd for cases_per100k and deaths_per100k

``` r
df_normalized %>% 
    filter(!is.na(cases_per100k) & !is.na(deaths_per100k) & date == "2022-05-11") %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_cases_per100k = mean(cases_per100k, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_cases_per100k = sd(cases_per100k, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_deaths_per100k = mean(deaths_per100k, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_deaths_per100k = sd(deaths_per100k, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   mean_cases_per100k sd_cases_per100k mean_deaths_per100k sd_deaths_per100k
    ##                <dbl>            <dbl>               <dbl>             <dbl>
    ## 1             24934.            6167.                375.              160.

- Which rows did you pick?
  - I excluded all rows with NA(missing) values. And I picked 2022/05/11
    as my date to focus on because I found in q7 that that’s one of the
    days where the peak cases/100k happened.
- Why?
  - Because the counties with NA values still gets added to the total
    counties count, however, their population is being treated as 0
    which skews up the data during calculation. I thought it would be
    interesting to see the mean and sd of one of the days where the peak
    number of cases occurred.

### **q7** Find and compare the top 10

Find the top 10 counties in terms of `cases_per100k`, and the top 10 in
terms of `deaths_per100k`. Report the population of each county along
with the per-100,000 counts. Compare the counts against the mean values
you found in q6. Note any observations.

``` r
## TASK: Find the top 10 max cases_per100k counties; report populations as well
top_10_counties <- df_normalized %>%
  group_by(county, state) %>%  
  slice_max(order_by = cases_per100k, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) %>%

**Observations**:

- It’s interesting to note that counties in Texas consistently appear in
  the top 10 for both cases and deaths. Interestingly, some counties in
  states like Alaska show up in the top 10 for cases but not for deaths,
  while the opposite is true for Virginia, which has three counties in
  the top 10 for deaths per 100k but not for cases.
- When did these “largest values” occur?
  - The peak cases per 100k in the top 10 counties were concentrated
    around a few days in mid-May, with one exception that occurred at
    the end of March. What really stands out is that most of the top 10
    counties for deaths per 100k saw their highest values earlier, and
    the timing of these peaks was much more scattered. In contrast, the
    peak cases were tightly concentrated, happening primarily in those
    few days in May.
- Comparing mean from q6:
  - The mean cases per 100k from Q6 was 24,934, while the mean deaths
    per 100k was 375. When comparing this to the top 10 counties with
    the highest cases per 100k, we see that even the 10th-ranked county
    has nearly double the mean cases from Q6. This is expected because
    the mean from Q6 accounts for all counties, whereas the top 10
    counties are specifically those with the highest case rates. These
    extreme values lie in the “tail” of the distribution. The same
    pattern holds when comparing the mean deaths per 100k from Q6 to the
    top 10 counties with the highest death rates per 100k. These
    counties represent outliers in the overall distribution.

## Self-directed EDA

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q8** Drive your own ship: You’ve just put together a very rich dataset; you now get to explore! Pick your own direction and generate at least one punchline figure to document an interesting finding. I give a couple tips & ideas below:

### Ideas

<!-- ------------------------- -->

- Look for outliers.

- Try web searching for news stories in some of the outlier counties.

- Investigate relationships between county population and counts.

- Do a deep-dive on counties that are important to you (e.g. where you
  or your family live).

- Fix the *geographic exceptions* noted below to study New York City.

- Your own idea!

  -I looked at randomly selected counties in California (that I know of)
  2 from norcal and 3 from socal. (Yolo is the county I am from). I
  wanted to compare the deaths with the cases because I had a hypothesis
  that the deaths will follow the pattern of the cases with a time
  delay. I found that it was actually really heard to tell in this plot
  because the timeline was stretched over 2 years. But one interesting
  observation I had is that there’s is a clear surge of cases around
  2021-01, and we also see the death cases follow this trend of the bump
  in cases. However, there’s another clear bump around 2022-01, but we
  actually don’t see any clear bumps in the death rates. This can lead
  to hypothesis such as that a lot of people got vaccinated and the
  vaccines are effective against severe complications so although more
  people got COVID there aren’t clear increase of people who died of
  COVID.

**DO YOUR OWN ANALYSIS HERE**

``` r
df_normalized %>%
  filter(
    state == "California",  # Focus on California
    county %in% c("Los Angeles", "San Diego", "San Francisco", "Yolo", "Riverside"), 
    !is.na(fips)
  ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = date)) +
    geom_line(aes(y = cases, color = county,linetype = "cases"), size = 1) + 
    geom_line(aes(y = deaths, color = county, linetype = "deaths"), size = 1) +
    scale_y_log10()+

    title = "Cases vs Deaths from 2020 to 2022 in selected counties for california",
    x = "Date",

### Aside: Some visualization tricks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

These data get a little busy, so it’s helpful to know a few `ggplot`
tricks to help with the visualization. Here’s an example focused on
Massachusetts.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this; just an example
library(scales)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'scales'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
    ## 
    ##     discard

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:readr':
    ## 
    ##     col_factor

``` r
df_normalized %>%
  filter(
    state == "Massachusetts", # Focus on Mass only
    !is.na(fips), # fct_reorder2 can choke with missing data
  ) %>%

  ggplot(
    aes(date, cases_per100k, color = fct_reorder2(county, date, cases_per100k))
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_log10(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()))+
  scale_color_discrete(name = "County") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Cases (per 100,000 persons)"
  )
```

![](c06-covid19-assignment_files/figure-gfm/ma-example-1.png)<!-- -->

*Tricks*:

- I use `fct_reorder2` to *re-order* the color labels such that the
  color in the legend on the right is ordered the same as the vertical
  order of rightmost points on the curves. This makes it easier to
  reference the legend.
- I manually set the `name` of the color scale in order to avoid
  reporting the `fct_reorder2` call.
- I use `scales::label_number_si` to make the vertical labels more
  readable.
- I use `theme_minimal()` to clean up the theme a bit.
- I use `labs()` to give manual labels.

### Geographic exceptions

<!-- ------------------------- -->

The NYT repo documents some [geographic
exceptions](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data#geographic-exceptions);
the data for New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx and Richmond counties are
consolidated under “New York City” *without* a fips code. Thus the
normalized counts in `df_normalized` are `NA`. To fix this, you would
need to merge the population data from the New York City counties, and
manually normalize the data.

# Notes

\[1\] The census used to have many, many questions, but the ACS was
created in 2010 to remove some questions and shorten the census. You can
